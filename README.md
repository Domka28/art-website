The art-website application is a website that serves as a gallery for selling paintings. 
However, it does not include a purchase option; instead, it provides the ability 
to send a message expressing interest in the offer.

The application was created for educational purposes based on a real art offer. 
To build the website, I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
